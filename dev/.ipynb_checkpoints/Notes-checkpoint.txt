This is what worked to make HighFive work:
On the CMAKE lists:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.26.3)

project(LOADHDF5)

find_package(HighFive REQUIRED)

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} main.cpp)

target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} HighFive)


Then I cmake with 
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="third_party/HighFive/build/install/" -S ../../
make
./LOADHDF5 to run it
