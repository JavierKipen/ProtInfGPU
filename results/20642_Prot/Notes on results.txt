Oracle_dif errs has different runs with the oracle on the whole proteome with different errors
Oracle_subsets has different amount of reads for each run.
ProbeamBetterConfigW2 Runs probeam on the data and the oracle with same dataset. W2 means that there is 2 original samples of each flustring, that then are sampled accordingly. This is a smaller dataset, faster and gives an idea of W100 results.
ProbeamW2 has the paper configs in terms of errors. Then also 2 samples per each and same crossval as the other, to compare the three of them.
SparsityProbeamBetterConfigW2 shows different Nsparsity for the better probeam. Still with W2 for previsualization of the paper.
